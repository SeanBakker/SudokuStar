Notes for Game Development -------------

Idea: Board Creation with removing cells
https://www.createclassicsudoku.com/How_Do_I_Measure_Sudoku_Puzzle_Difficulty_Level.jsp

AFTER SUBMIT IDEAS:
- give hint for error upon selecting the resume button (if board was a fail - could even have successful board hide the resume button)
- highlight any error cells with red background - use solver to compare wrong cells

BUG FIXES:
- clear filter on note taking buttons (gray colour instead of gold)
- App crashes in between creating boards (too much running code)
- App crashes on clicking submit button (still runs code for solveBoard???) (sometimes just randomly)
- App crashes randomly - code running in background may crash - just select "wait" option
- App crashes on loading "hard" game boards (sometimes it is too difficult to create a board and needs someway of resetting but not crashing)

PLANNED FEATURES:
- Add hint button to give hint upon clicking - choose random cell with a possible value to input (highlight with light green)
- Diagonal game board - add diagonals as extra option for 1-9

APP DESIGN:
- App Header: Have a star logo beside the SudokuStar app name
- Add more app themes and buttons
- New game modes with sudoku twists (diagonal, snakes, etc)
- Loading button for long board creations (ideally we can reduce board build time)
